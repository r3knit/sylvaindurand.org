## Colophon
This website is produced thanks to the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is entirely [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page): it works only with HTML and CSS, and does not use any dynamic language. Particular attention is paid to [typography](http://webtypography.net/) and to [vertical rhythm](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2).

Each page is illustrated with a part from the [Turgot map of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgot_map_of_Paris), created in the 18<sup>th</sup> century.

You will here find the files from the `/content/` folder.
